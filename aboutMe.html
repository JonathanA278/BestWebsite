      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a photographer with a deep passion for storytelling—whether it's through the lens of my camera or the written word on a page. Ever since I first picked up a camera, I’ve been drawn to the way a single image can capture emotion, movement, and meaning all at once. There's something powerful about freezing a moment in time, especially when that moment might otherwise go unnoticed. I find beauty in the everyday—sunlight hitting a sidewalk just right, a fleeting expression during a conversation, the quiet details that most people pass by. Photography gives me a way to highlight those little things and share them in a way that words sometimes can't.
<br>
Beyond photography, I channel that same love for storytelling into my work with the school newspaper, which I currently lead. As editor-in-chief, I oversee every part of the publication process—from brainstorming article ideas and editing final drafts to designing layouts and coordinating with our team of writers and photographers. It's a big responsibility, but it's also one of the most rewarding parts of my high school experience. I take pride in making sure each issue reflects the voice and personality of our student body. Whether we're covering school events, highlighting student achievements, or tackling important topics, I strive to ensure that our paper is honest, engaging, and relevant.
<br>
What drives me in both photography and journalism is the desire to connect with people and to give a platform to stories that matter. I believe that everyone has a story worth telling, and my goal is to tell those stories in the most authentic and impactful way possible. Whether I’m behind the camera capturing a quiet moment, interviewing someone for a feature article, or laying out a front-page spread, I’m committed to using my creativity and leadership to make those stories come to life. To me, storytelling isn't just an art—it's a way of building understanding, creating empathy, and celebrating the diverse voices in our community.</p>
